The challenge is to determine the maximum number of urinals in a men's restroom that are available for use without charge, as long as no two urinals are used in quick succession. A urinal that is not in use is represented by 0, whereas one that is is used is represented by 1. A string of 1s and 0s is used to symbolize the collection of urinals. If this string contains any characters other than 0 and 1, it is invalid. Additionally, if there are more than two consecutive 1s, the string is incorrect (-1 is returned in such case). One would anticipate finding a number of usable urinals in such a situation.

For development, Urinals.java, vacantUrinalsCount.java and UrinalsTest.java were created.
The input list of urinal sets is contained in string format in the urinals.dat file.
The output is in rule.txt. rule1.txt, rule2.txt so on ....
